# To visualize an earthquake data set

1. Data Source : https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php

2. Import & Visualize the Data: 

-Create a map using Leaflet that plots all of the earthquakes from data set based on their longitude and latitude.


-Included data markers, which reflect the magnitude of the earthquake in their size and color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes appear larger and darker in color.


-Included popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when a marker is clicked.


-Created a legend that will provide context for your map data.
